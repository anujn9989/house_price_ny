# Predicting House Prices in Saratoga County, New York
This project aimed to develop a predictive model for house prices in Saratoga County, New York, leveraging multiple regression analysis. We conducted thorough data validation, including checks for linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality, ensuring the robustness of our model. Through backward variable selection, we identified 13 significant predictor variables, enabling the construction of an accurate regression equation for price prediction.

Utilizing advanced statistical techniques and machine learning principles, we assessed the out-of-sample predictive performance of our model using 10-fold cross-validation, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness in predicting house prices. Additionally, we visualized the spatial distribution of house prices and their predictors, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the real estate industry.

Our project not only showcases proficiency in regression modeling and predictive analytics but also highlights the applicability of data science methodologies in addressing real-world challenges in the housing market.
